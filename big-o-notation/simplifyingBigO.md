# Constants don't matter (with a few exceptions)
 boils down to the powers of n as it grows, if your n gets to 600000, why do you care about the 10 in an n+10? the trend depends on n, or n^2, or n(log(n))


 auxiliary space complexity denotes how much extra memory or storage space that gets used up by the algorithm.
